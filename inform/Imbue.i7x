Version 1 of Imbue by Nate Moore begins here.

Using Imbue is a truth state that varies. Using Imbue is usually true.

To say span for (text - text) class (class - text) name (name - text) actions (action - text):
	say "[if Using Imbue is true]<span class='[class]' data-name='[name]' data-actions='[action]'>[text]</span>[else][text][end if]"

Imbue ends here.
